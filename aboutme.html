     <h1>This is all about my life as a military brat!</h1>
         <p>A military brat is a military dependent (child). My father has been in the air force for 21 years.</p>

     <h1>I've lived in 10 different houses within four different states and two countries.</h1>
         <p>(California, Texas, Rhode Island, Virigina, Germany)</p>

     <h1>I've transferred schools 7 times.</h1>
         <p>The military lifestyle usually requires famillies to relocate regularly. Sometimes families are separated as well. My dad has been deployed for six month intervals in which he may be living across the country from us. </p>

    <h1>My first project in APCSP 2022-23 was to create a small interactive safari park drawing using the python turtle module.</h1> 
    <h1>The project first creates a truck on a safari background. It then prompts the user to choose a direction.</h1>
    <h1>Depending on the direction chosen, an image of a lion or elephant will be displayed.</h1>
    <h1>This project uses the replit console so a fork (separate copy) is necessary for running the prompts.</h1>

    <h1>My next project was a bit more complicated than the first.</h1> 
    <h1>The game we created was inspired by the many online idle clicker games.</h1>
    <h1>The objective of the game is to amass as much money as possible.</h1>
    <h1>The user will click the various buttons to make money and invest; all with the end goal of making more money!</h1>

    <h1>This project was an e-card intended for kids at a children's hospital.</h1> 
    <h1>We created this in November in preparation for the holidays!</h1>
    <h1>The card also has a small game about delivering presents to kids.</h1>
    <h1>The user will press the space bar to drop a present down below!</h1>

    <h1>We worked on another project for experimental purposes.</h1> 
    <h1>The project is a simple platformer game using the program Scratch.</h1>
    <h1>The assets were mostly provided by Scratch.</h1>

    <h1>PLTW Data Analysis Project</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="images/graphs.png" height="250">
    <br>
    <h1>The PLTW assignment had us interpreting data from a space rover.</h1> 
    <h1>Data was given in a very compressed format and had to be both visualized and sorted.</h1>
    <h1>Using the data we deciphered, we found that the rover was located on a desert plain.</h1>
    <h1>This conclusion came about due to the constant loud sounds and varying regularity of winds that were only from desert plains.</h1>
    <br>The result turned out to be incorrect as we mixed up temperature and light. We also interpreted the gyro graph incorrectly.
